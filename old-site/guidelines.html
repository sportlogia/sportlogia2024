          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p><br />
            <em><strong>Journal intention</strong></em><br />
          SportLogia journal covers the areas of sports  and physical education. It publishes once a year and publishes original  scientific papers, reviewed scientific papers, scientific gathering  presentations, short scientific articles and professional articles from the  area of sports, physical education, recreation, kinesiology anthropology,  training methods, sport biology and exercise, sport medicine,  biomechanics,  sport  history   and  sport  management   as well as contributions from other sciences (medicine, sociology,  psychology, philosophy, exact sciences and mathematics) applied in sports.</p>
          <p><strong><br />
            <em>General remarks on papers</em></strong><br />
            All manuscripts are  submitted to the journal’s editors, who,  after reading the manuscripts, decide about the further procedure: (1) the  manuscript is immediately sent for review; (2) if there are any objections and  suggestions, the manuscript is sent back to the author for corrections; (3)  rejection of the manuscript. The editor may decline the manuscript in the  following cases: (1) the topic of the manuscript is not relevant; (2) a  manuscript with a similar topic has already been published in the journal; (3)  the manuscript does not conform to the standards of the journal. If the  manuscript is not accepted, a short notice is sent to the author, but the  manuscript is not sent back. The process of preliminary evaluation lasts up to  4 weeks.<br />
            If the author has corrected the text in  accordance with the instructions from the editor, the manuscript is sent for  review. In that case, the author will be given a form called <em>Copyrights  Declaration</em>, which needs to be filled in and sent back to the editor. The  signature of the author verifies the authenticity of the text, authorship and  acceptance of the review procedure.<br />
            All articles must be reviewed. There will be  two reviewers from the relevant scientific area for each article, and both  reviews will be anonymous. The author's name will be unknown to the reviewers  (double blind review). If a reviewer finds the article noncompliant with the  criteria of the journal, the editorial will not accept the article. The review  process lasts 8 to 12 weeks. If, on the other hand, the reviewers find the   article acceptable, it will be put in one of  the following categories: <br />
            <em>Original scientific paper</em> is a first  publication of original research results in a form that the research can be  repeated, and the asserted facts verified. It is organized in accordance with  the IMRAD scheme for experimental research or in a descriptive way for  descriptive science areas.<br />
            <em>Scientific work review</em> is a review of papers  on a specific topic, works of an individual researcher or a group of  researchers whose aim is to summarize, analyze, evaluate or synthesize already  published information. It brings new syntheses which also include results of  author's own research.<br />
            <em>Short scientific article</em> is an original  scientific article which may skip some elements of IMRAD. It concisely presents  results of a completed own research or of an ongoing research.<br />
            <em>Scientific gathering presentation</em> is a  comprehensive article that has previously been briefed to a scientific  gathering, but it has not been published in its comprehensive form in the Paper  Collection Book of the gathering.<br />
            <em>Professional  article</em> is a review of something that is already  known, with an emphasis on the usability of the results of the original  research and the spread of knowledge. The complexity of the text is adjusted to  the needs of the professional and scientific aspects of the journal.<br />
            After reviews have been done, the editorial  board will analyze them. If needed, the paper is sent back to the author who  must comply with the suggestions and objections made by the reviewers. Once  they have redone the paper, the authors need to specifically describe, on a <em>separate  sheet of paper</em>, how they have resolved the reviewer’s suggestions.<br />
            Only those papers that have been placed in one  of the categories and which have <em>two positive reviews will be published</em>.<br />
          </p>
          <p><em><strong>Text style and organization</strong></em><br />
            Scientific articles must adhere to the IMRAD  scheme (Introduction, Methods, Results and   Discussion).<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Title</em></strong><br />
          The title page of the manuscript should contain  the following information: (1) a concise, but informative title. Use of  abbreviations is not encouraged; (2) the author’s names (do not include  degrees); the last one is introduced by &quot;&amp;&quot;; (3) the affiliation  of the authors, town and state; (4) the name and address of the corresponding  author (must include title, degree and position of the corresponding author, phone  and fax numbers – zip code for the country and city, and email address).</p>
          <p><br />
            <em><strong>Summary, large summary and key words</strong></em><strong></strong><br />
            The  summary should be brief and Self-explanatory. It should cover a general  presentation of the topic (the purpose and the  objective of the paper), results and conclusions. Authors should not use  abbreviations.  The abstract should  include 150-250 words. Authors from abroad write the large summary in their  native languge (the summary has to be reviewed), and the authors whose native  language is BCS write the mentioned summary in one of the official languages of  the IOC Assembly (article 27 of Olympic Charter), except English. The  translation should be made by relevant person.<br />
            Large summary should not exceed 1800 characters  (up to tree pages of double spaced text), and should include title, keywords  and summary text. <br />
            Three to six words, which are not part of the  title, need to  be  singled   out.  The  Key   words  need  to   reflect  the contents of the  paper.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong><br />

          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Results</em></strong><br />
            The results should be presented as tables,  graphs and pictures, possibly processed statistically and be concisely  presented in the text.<br />
            Tables, graphs and pictures showing the results  of individual analyses need to be indicated in the text for easier reader  navigation.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong><br />
            The authors are expected here to comment  on  the results and compare them with  literature data. The discussion must be professional and correspond to  experimental data. Practical implications are welcome.<br />

          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Tables, graphs and pictures</em></strong><br />
            Each table and any illustration (black and  white only) must be submitted on a separate sheet of paper. Tables should be  numbered in the order in which they occur in the text and referred to as, for  example, &quot;Table 1&quot;. Each table should be accompanied by a short  title. Tables should be accompanied with interpretations (legends). It will  also be deemed informative if the tables include indications of important  correlations and relevant variables. Tables should be submitted separately<br />

Photographs are sent in electronic form in a  resolution not smaller than 300 dpi and in a .tif (figures) and .eps (graphics)  format. Each figure needs to have a short title. In case that the figures are  taken over from another paper, the title should not include the original name.  In such a case, the source where the picture was taken from should be indicated  under the picture.<br />
            If tables, graphs and pictures contain special  symbols, or are prepared in a special program, they must be submitted in a  separate file, with clearly indicated order of their inclusion in the text.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Article technical form</em></strong><br />
            Articles are written and published in Latin  alphabet, and, when needed, in other alphabets, in the Serbian language  (ijekavica dialect) and the English language.
