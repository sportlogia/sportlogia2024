              <td class="small"><em>&quot;In the course of growth and development, affected by various internal  and external factors, various postural disorders may occur, especially in  school-age children. Scoliosis is defined as a lateral curvature of the spinal  column in the coronal plane, but the disorder actually occurs in three  dimensions. The prevalence of scoliosis is from 2% to 3%, and it is the highest  in patients in the 12-14 age range, affecting girls more than boys at a ratio  of 2:1. Functional scoliosis occurs more frequently than structural scoliosis.  Idiopathic scoliosis is structural scoliosis which has no definite cause; it  may progress and affect the function of internal organ systems and occurrence  of back pain. Annual children&rsquo;s medical check-ups and early detection of  scoliosis are essential for treatment of scoliosis. Treatment depends on the  size and progression of the curve, skeletal maturity, scope of physical therapy  and observation. The potential association between adolescent idiopathic  scoliosis and sports is still insufficiently researched. Young athletes may  have spinal deformities which are not related to any sports activity or may be  potentially associated with the sport they practise. The International  Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment has  come up with the guidelines for sports activities in children with scoliosis.  This association does not recommend sport for treatment of idiopathic  scoliosis. Sports activities are recommended due to their specific useful  effects in the psychological, neuromuscular and general aspect of health in  patients with scoliosis, even in patients during the treatment with spinal  orthoses. In patients with a high risk of scoliosis progression, it is  recommended to avoid competitive activities with a higher degree of mobility of  the spinal column&quot;</em></td>

              <td class="small"><em>&quot;The primary role of vitamin D is regulation of  calcium, phosphorus and bone metabolism. Vitamin D status assessment is based  on measuring of 25 (OH) D concentrations, and disorders of vitamin D status may  be manifested as a vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D  hypervitaminosis. It is generally accepted that values above 75 nmol / L will  suffice to prevent the occurrence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although  vitamin D deficiency can be found at any age, it is most common in women with  postmenopausal osteoporosis, and in older women. The aim of this study was to  determine the vitamin D status, parathyroid hormone levels and calcium levels  in women with newly diagnosed postmenopausal osteoporosis, and to compare the  results with the same parameters observed and measured in women without  osteoporosis, and to establish whether there is a connection between vitamin D  levels and levels of other parameters. The study involved 85 postmenopausal  women, all of which were screened for osteoporosis by measuring bone mineral  density in the lumbar spine and hip region using DXA method. Of these, 50 women  were found to have osteoporosis while 35 had regular DXA values. Our results  showed a high incidence of vitamin D deficiency in postmenopausal women, with  significantly higher vitamin D deficiency in women with osteoporosis. The  values of parathyroid hormone were higher, and the values of ionized calcium  were lower in women with osteoporosis, and there is a negative correlation  between 25 (OH) D and parathyroid hormone. The most common risk factors for  osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women were early menopause and previous  fracture in adulthood. Reduced levels of vitamin D in women with postmenopausal  osteoporosis leads to changes in calcium and parathyroid hormone metabolism

    <td class="small"><em>&quot;</em>Many athletes use supplements in their  diet as part of regular training or competition, thus enabling more intense  training by encouraging faster recovery between workouts, minimizing  interference caused by disease or injury and increasing competitive performance.  These supplements, unlike medications, are not subject to rigorous efficiency  and safety checks and tests. There is a risk with regard to those supplements  which include positive doping test result as a consequence of presence of the  prohibited substances not listed in the declaration of the preparation.
        The aim of this study was to examine the  use of supplements among elite athletes by analyzing the forms for doping  control, issued by the Agency for Anti-doping control of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, performed in the period from 2010 to 2012. The study includes  supplements whose use was reported by athletes in the period of the last 7 days  (prior testing).
        The study results indicate the frequency  of dietary supplements use of 34.5%. The most dominant group among users of  dietary supplements were men aged between 18 and 29 years. From 152 users of  dietary supplements 62.3% of them have used more than one product. The number  of used supplements was an average of 2.9±2.8 products. Amino acids and  proteins are the most commonly used dietary supplements. This  study confirmed excessive use of dietary supplements among elite athletes and  pointed to the need of necessary education and ensuring the availability of  scientific and unbiased information, about the benefits and risks of dietary  supplements use, to athletes<em>&quot;.</em></td>
